\section sec1 (1) What is CUB?

\par
CUB provides state-of-the-art, reusable software components for every layer 
of the CUDA programming model:
- <b><em>Primitives</em></b>
  - [<b><em>Device-wide</em></b>] (group___device_module.html) 
    - Parallel sort, prefix scan, reduction, histogram, etc.  
    - Compatible with CUDA dynamic parallelism
  - [<b><em>Block-wide "collective"</em></b>] (group___block_module.html)
    - Cooperative I/O, sort, prefix scan, reduction, histogram, etc.  
    - Compatible with arbitrary thread block sizes and types 
  - [<b><em>Warp-wide "collective"</em></b>] (group___warp_module.html)
    - Cooperative warp-wide prefix scan, reduction, etc.
    - Safe and architecture-specific
- <b><em>Utilities</em></b>
  - [<b><em>Fancy iterators</em></b>] (group___util_iterator.html)
  - [<b><em>Thread and thread block I/O</em></b>] (group___util_io.html)
  - [<b><em>PTX intrinsics</em></b>] (group___util_ptx.html)
  - [<b><em>Device, kernel, and storage management</em></b>] (group___util_mgmt.html)

\subsection sec1sec1 1.1 Collective Primitives 
\par
As a SIMT programming model, CUDA engenders both <em><b>scalar</b></em> and 
<em><b>collective</b></em> software interfaces. Traditional software 
interfaces are <em>scalar</em> : a single thread invokes a library routine to perform some 
operation (which may include spawning parallel subtasks).  Alternatively, a <em>collective</em> 
interface is entered simultaneously by a group of parallel threads to perform 
some cooperative operation.  Collective SIMT primitives are essential for constructing 
performance-portable kernels for use in higher level software abstractions, libraries, 
domain-specific languages, etc.  

\par
\image html cub_overview.png
<div class="centercaption">Orientation of <em>collective</em> primitives within the CUDA software stack</div>

\par
CUB's collective primitives are not bound to any particular width of parallelism 
or to any particular data type.  This allows them to be:
- <b><em>Adaptable</em></b> to fit the needs of the enclosing kernel computation
- <b><em>Trivially tunable</em></b> to different grain sizes (threads per block, 
  items per thread, etc.)

\par
Thus CUB is [<em>CUDA Unbound</em>](index.html).

\subsection sec1sec2 1.2 Design Motivation 
\par 
CUB is inspired by the following goals:
- <em><b>Absolute performance</b></em>.  CUB primitives are specialized and tuned to 
  best match the features and capabilities of each CUDA architecture.
- <em><b>Enhanced programmer productivity</b></em>.  CUB primitives allow developers to quickly 
  compose sequences of complex parallel operations in both CUDA kernel code and CUDA host code.       
- <em><b>Enhanced tunability</b></em>.  CUB primitives allow developers to quickly 
  change grain sizes (threads per block, items per thread, etc.).       
- <em><b>Reduced maintenance burden</b></em>.  CUB provides a SIMT software abstraction layer 
  over the diversity of CUDA hardware.  With CUB, applications can enjoy 
  performance-portability without intensive and costly rewriting or porting efforts.  

\section sec2 (2) An Example (block-sorting)

\par
The following code snippet presents a CUDA kernel in which each block of 128 threads 
will collectively load, sort, and store its own segment of 2048 integer keys:

\par
\code
#include <cub/cub.cuh>

// Block-sorting CUDA kernel (128 threads owning 16 integer items each)
__global__ void BlockSortKernel(int *d_in, int *d_out)
{
    using namespace cub;

    // Specialize BlockRadixSort, BlockLoad, and BlockStore collective types
    typedef BlockRadixSort<int, 128, 16>                     BlockRadixSort;
    typedef BlockLoad<int*, 128, 16, BLOCK_LOAD_TRANSPOSE>   BlockLoad;
    typedef BlockStore<int*, 128, 16, BLOCK_STORE_TRANSPOSE> BlockStore;

    // Allocate shared memory for collectives
    __shared__ union {
        typename BlockRadixSort::TempStorage  sort;
        typename BlockLoad::TempStorage       load; 
        typename BlockStore::TempStorage      store; 
    } temp_storage; 

    int block_offset = blockIdx.x * (128 * 16);	  // Offset for this block's segment

    // Obtain a segment of 2048 consecutive keys that are blocked across threads
    int thread_keys[16];
    BlockLoad(temp_storage.load).Load(d_in + blocffset, thread_keys);
    __syncthreads();

    // Collectively sort the keys
    BlockRadixSort(temp_storage.sort).Sort(thread_keys);
    __syncthreads();

    // Store the sorted segment 
    BlockStore(temp_storage.store).Store(d_out + block_offset, thread_keys);
}
\endcode

\par
Each thread block uses cub::BlockRadixSort to collectively sort 
its own input segment.  The class is specialized by the 
data type being sorted, by the number of threads per block, by the number of 
keys per thread, and implicitly by the targeted compilation architecture.  

\par
The cub::BlockLoad and cub::BlockStore classes are similarly specialized.    
Furthermore, to provide coalesced accesses to device memory, these primitives are 
configured to access memory using a striped access pattern (where consecutive threads 
simultaneously access consecutive items) and then <em>transpose</em> the keys into 
a [<em>blocked arrangement</em>](index.html#sec5sec4) of elements across threads. 

\par
Once specialized, these classes expose opaque \p TempStorage member types.  
The thread block uses these storage types to statically allocate the union of 
shared memory needed by the thread block.  (Alternatively these storage types 
could be aliased to global memory allocations).

\section sec3 (3) How is CUB different than Thrust?

\par
CUB and [<b><em>Thrust</em></b>](http://thrust.github.com/) have some similarities in that they 
both provide device-wide primitives for CUDA.  However, the Thrust abstractions are 
agnostic of any particular implementation (e.g., CUDA, TBB, OpenMP, sequential 
CPU, etc.).  While Thrust has a "backend" for CUDA devices, Thrust interfaces 
themselves are not CUDA-specific and do not explicitly expose CUDA-specific 
details (e.g., \p cudaStream_t parameters).
  
\par
CUB, on the other hand, is slightly lower-level than Thrust.  CUB is CUDA-specific
and its interfaces explicitly accommodate CUDA-specific features.  Furthermore, CUB is also 
a library of SIMT collective primitives for block-wide and warp-wide kernel programming.
CUB is complimentary to Thrust in that it can be used to implement portions of Thrust's 
CUDA backend.  In fact, the CUB project arose out of a maintenance need for easier 
performance-portability within Thrust.   

\section sec4 (4) Why do you need CUB?

\par
Constructing, tuning, and maintaining kernel code is perhaps the most challenging, 
time-consuming aspect of CUDA programming.  CUDA kernel software is where 
the complexity of parallelism is expressed. Programmers must reason about 
deadlock, livelock, synchronization, race conditions, shared memory layout, 
plurality of state, granularity, throughput, latency, memory bottlenecks, etc. 

\par
However, with the exception of CUB, there are few (if any) software libraries of
reusable kernel primitives. In the CUDA ecosystem, CUB is unique in this regard.
As a [SIMT](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#hardware-implementation)
library and software abstraction layer, CUB provides:
-# <b><em>Simplicity of composition</em></b>. CUB primitives can be simply sequenced 
   and nested in kernel code.  For example, cub::BlockRadixSort is constructed from 
   cub::BlockExchange and cub::BlockRadixRank. The latter is composed of cub::BlockScan 
   which incorporates cub::WarpScan. \image html nested_composition.png
-# <b><em>High performance</em></b>. CUB simplifies high performance kernel 
   development by taking care to implement the state-of-the-art in parallel algorithms.  
   Expert code should be reused rather than reimplemented. 
-# <b><em>Performance portability</em></b>. CUB primitives are specialized to 
   match the diversity of NVIDIA hardware, continuously evolving to accommodate new 
   features and instructions.  For example, CUB reductions and prefix scans employ 
   warp-shuffle on Kepler GPUs.  Code should be recompiled rather than hand-ported.
-# <b><em>Simplicity of performance tuning</em></b>:
  - <em>Variant tuning</em>.  Most CUB primitives support alternative algorithmic 
    strategies. For example, cub::BlockHistogram is parameterized to implement either 
    an atomic-based approach or a sorting-based approach.  (The latter provides uniform 
    performance regardless of input distribution.)
  - <em>Kernel+library co-optimization</em>.  Most CUB primitives support arbitrary 
    granularity (threads per block, items per thread, etc.).  When the enclosing kernel 
    is similarly parameterizable, a configuration can be found that optimally 
    accommodates their combined register and shared memory pressure. 
-# <b><em>Robustness and durability</em></b>. CUB just works.  CUB primitives 
   are designed to function properly for arbitrary data types and widths of 
   parallelism (not just for the built-in C++ types or for powers-of-two threads 
   per block).
-# <b><em>A path for language evolution</em></b>.  CUB primitives are designed 
   to easily accommodate new features in the CUDA programming model, e.g., thread 
   subgroups and named barriers, dynamic shared memory allocators, etc. 

\section sec5 (5) How do CUB collectives work?
 
\par
Central to the design of CUB are two programming idioms: 
- <b><em>Generic programming</em></b>.  C++ templates provide the flexibility 
  and adaptive code generation needed for CUB primitives to be useful, reusable, and  
  fast in arbitrary kernel settings.
- <b><em>Reflective class interfaces</em></b>.  CUB collectives statically export their 
  their resource requirements (e.g., shared memory size and layout) for a 
  given specialization, which allows compile-time tuning decisions and resource 
  allocation.

\subsection sec5sec1 5.1 Template Specialization 
\par
We use template parameters to specialize CUB primitives for the particular 
problem setting at hand.  Until compile time, CUB primitives are not bound 
to any particular:
- Data type (int, float, double, etc.)
- Width of parallelism (threads array size)
- Grain size (data items per thread)
- Underlying processor (special instructions, warp size, rules for bank conflicts, etc.)
- Tuning configuration (e.g., latency vs. throughput, algorithm selection, etc.)

\subsection sec5sec2 5.2 Reflective Class Interfaces 
\par
Unlike traditional function-oriented interfaces, CUB exposes its collective 
primtives as templated C++ classes.  The resource requirements for a specific 
parameterization are reflectively advertised as members of the class.  The 
resources can then be statically or dynamically allocated, aliased
to global or shared memory, etc.   The following illustrates a CUDA kernel 
fragment performing a collective prefix sum across the threads of a thread block:

\par
\code
#include <cub/cub.cuh>

// Specialize BlockScan for 128 threads on integer types
typedef cub::BlockScan<int, 128> BlockScan;
 
// Allocate shared memory for BlockScan
__shared__ typename BlockScan::TempStorage scan_storage;

// Obtain a segment of consecutive items that are blocked across threads
int thread_data_in[4];
int thread_data_out[4];
...

// Perform an exclusive block-wide prefix sum
BlockScan(scan_storage).ExclusiveSum(thread_data_in, thread_data_out);

\endcode

\par
Furthermore, the CUB interface is designed to separate parameter 
fields by concerns.  CUB primitives have three distinct parameter fields:
-# <b><em>Static template parameters</em></b>.  These are constants that will 
   dictate the storage layout and the unrolling of algorithmic steps (e.g., 
   the input data type and the number of block threads), and are used to specialize the class.
-# <b><em>Constructor parameters</em></b>.  These are optional parameters regarding 
   inter-thread communication (e.g., storage allocation, thread-identifier mapping, 
   named barriers, etc.), and are orthogonal to the functions exposed by the class.
-# <b><em>Formal method parameters</em></b>. These are the operational inputs/outputs
   for the various functions exposed by the class.

\par
This allows CUB types to easily accommodate new 
programming model features (e.g., named barriers, memory allocators, etc.) 
without incurring a combinatorial growth of interface methods.   
 *
\subsection sec5sec3 5.3 Tuning and Adaptation
\par 
This style of flexible interface simplifies performance tuning.  Most CUB
primitives support alternative algorithmic strategies that can be
statically targeted by a compiler-based or JIT-based autotuner.  For
example, cub::BlockHistogram is parameterized to implement either an
atomic-based approach or a sorting-based approach.  Algorithms are also
tunable over parameters such as thread count and grain size as well.
Taken together, each of the CUB algorithms provides a fairly rich tuning
space.

\par
Whereas conventional libraries are optimized offline and in isolation, CUB 
provides interesting opportunities for whole-program optimization.  For 
example, each CUB primitive is typically parameterized by threads-per-block 
and items-per-thread, both of which affect the underlying algorithm's 
efficiency and resource requirements.  When the enclosing kernel is similarly 
parameterized, the coupled CUB primitives adjust accordingly.  This enables  
autotuners to search for a single configuration that maximizes the performance 
of the entire kernel for a given set of hardware resources.  
 
\subsection sec5sec4 5.4 Mapping data onto threads
\par
CUDA kernels are often designed such that each thread block is assigned a 
segment of data items for processing.

\par
\image html tile.png
<div class="centercaption">Segment of eight ordered data items</div>

\par
When the tile size equals the thread block size, the
mapping of data onto threads is straightforward (one datum per thread).
However, there are often performance advantages for processing more
than one datum per thread.  Increased granularity corresponds to 
decreased communication overhead.  For these scenarios, CUB primitives
will specify which of the following partitioning alternatives they 
accommodate:

<table border="0px" cellpadding="0px" cellspacing="0px"><tr>
<td>
\par
- <b><em>Blocked arrangement</em></b>.  The aggregate tile of items is partitioned
  evenly across threads in "blocked" fashion with thread<sub><em>i</em></sub>
  owning the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> segment of consecutive elements.
  Blocked arrangements are often desirable for algorithmic benefits (where
  long sequences of items can be processed sequentially within each thread).
</td>
<td>
\par
\image html blocked.png
<div class="centercaption"><em>Blocked</em> arrangement across four threads <br>(emphasis on items owned by <em>thread</em><sub>0</sub>)</div>
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>
\par
- <b><em>Striped arrangement</em></b>.  The aggregate tile of items is partitioned across
  threads in "striped" fashion, i.e., the \p ITEMS_PER_THREAD items owned by
  each thread have logical stride \p BLOCK_THREADS between them. Striped arrangements
  are often desirable for data movement through global memory (where
  [read/write coalescing](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/#coalesced-access-global-memory)</a>
  is an important performance consideration).
</td>
<td>
\par
\image html striped.png
<div class="centercaption"><em>Striped</em> arrangement across four threads <br>(emphasis on items owned by <em>thread</em><sub>0</sub>)</div>
</td>
</tr></table>

\par
The benefits of processing multiple items per thread (a.k.a., <em>register blocking</em>, <em>granularity coarsening</em>, etc.) include:
- Algorithmic efficiency.  Sequential work over multiple items in
  thread-private registers is cheaper than synchronized, cooperative
  work through shared memory spaces.
- Data occupancy.  The number of items that can be resident on-chip in
  thread-private register storage is often greater than the number of
  schedulable threads.
- Instruction-level parallelism.  Multiple items per thread also
  facilitates greater ILP for improved throughput and utilization.

\par
Finally, cub::BlockExchange provides operations for converting between blocked
and striped arrangements.
